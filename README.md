All the pictures were downloaded from https://normmanetwork.com/links-to-the-war-illustrated-on-the-internet-archive/, a website that provides access to the digitized collection of The War Illustrated, a World War I magazine published from August 1914 to February 1919.

The folder may not include all the pictures of dogs, but I have done my best to gather them.â€¨Thank you for your interest :)
